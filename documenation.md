### 1. **Install Python**

First, you need to install Python on your system.

#### On Windows:
- **Download** the latest version of Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Run the installer** and make sure to check the box that says **Add Python to PATH** during installation.

#### On macOS:
- Use **Homebrew** to install Python. First, install Homebrew (if you haven't already) and then run:
  ```bash
  brew install python
  ```
- Alternatively, you can download the installer from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

#### On Linux:
- Use the package manager to install Python (most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed).
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3
  ```

Check if Python was installed correctly by running:

```bash
python --version  # or python3 --version
```

You should see the installed version of Python.

---

### 2. **Set Up Virtual Environments**

Using **virtual environments** is crucial to avoid dependency conflicts between different projects.

#### Create a Virtual Environment:

1. Navigate to your project folder:

   ```bash
   cd your_project_folder
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment using the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv  # On some systems you may need to use python3
   ```

   This will create a `venv` directory that contains a separate Python environment.

#### Activate the Virtual Environment:

- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

After activation, you'll see the environment name (`venv`) in your terminal, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

#### Deactivate the Virtual Environment:

To exit the virtual environment, simply type:

```bash
deactivate
```

---

### 3. **Install Necessary Libraries (Dependencies)**

Once inside your virtual environment, you can start installing the necessary libraries for your project.

For example, if you're working on a web app with **FastAPI**, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

To install other packages (like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Django**, etc.), use:

```bash
pip install <package_name>
```

If you have a list of dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file, you can install them all at once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can generate this `requirements.txt` by running:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. **Configure an IDE or Text Editor**

Using a good **IDE** or **text editor** can improve your productivity while writing Python code.

#### Popular Python IDEs/Text Editors:

- **VS Code**: Highly recommended, lightweight, and supports Python development out-of-the-box with extensions.
  
  - Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the **Python extension** from the marketplace.
  
  - If you are using **VS Code**, you can also install the **Pylance extension** for enhanced type checking and IntelliSense.

- **PyCharm**: A powerful IDE designed specifically for Python development. It has a free community version and a paid professional version.
  
  - Download **PyCharm** from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

- **Sublime Text**: A lightweight editor with support for Python through various plugins.

- **Atom**: A customizable text editor that supports Python with plugins.

#### Configuring VS Code for Python:
1. Install **Python** extension from the VS Code marketplace.
2. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`), then search for `Python: Select Interpreter`.
3. Select the virtual environment interpreter (it will usually show as `./venv/bin/python` or similar).

---

### 5. **Run Python Code**

Once the environment is set up, you can run Python code.

- **In the terminal** (with the virtual environment activated), you can run a Python script by typing:

  ```bash
  python script_name.py  # or python3 script_name.py on some systems
  ```

- **In the IDE**: Most IDEs have a built-in **Run** button to execute your Python scripts.

---

### 6. **Using Version Control (Git)**

Version control is an essential part of modern software development, and Git is the most widely used version control system.

#### Initialize Git:
1. Inside your project folder, run:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude virtual environment files and unnecessary files from being tracked. Hereâ€™s a basic example of `.gitignore` for Python:

   ```
   __pycache__/
   *.pyc
   *.pyo
   venv/
   *.env
   .venv/
   ```

3. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

#### Using GitHub or GitLab:
You can then push the repository to services like **GitHub** or **GitLab** for remote storage and collaboration.

---

### 7. **Testing and Linting Tools**

To ensure high-quality code, consider setting up testing and linting tools.

- **pytest**: A testing framework to help write simple unit tests for your code.
  ```bash
  pip install pytest
  ```

- **black**: A code formatter to automatically format your code.
  ```bash
  pip install black
  ```

- **flake8**: A linting tool to enforce coding style and check for errors.
  ```bash
  pip install flake8
  ```

You can integrate these tools into your IDE for seamless development.

---

### 8. **Using Jupyter Notebooks (Optional)**

If youâ€™re working with data science or machine learning, setting up Jupyter Notebooks can be very helpful.

Install Jupyter with:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Run a Jupyter notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
