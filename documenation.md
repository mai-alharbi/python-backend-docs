## **[Environment Setup](#environment-setup)**

Setting up a Python development environment ensures that you can write and run Python code in a clean and isolated environment, making it easier to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects.

---

### **[Install Python](#install-python)**

Before you can use Python, you'll need to install it on your system.

#### Windows:
1. Download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer and make sure to **check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"**.
3. Verify the installation by opening the command prompt and running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

#### macOS:
1. You can install Python using **Homebrew**:
   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```
2. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based):
1. Install Python using the package manager:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3
   ```

---

### **[Create a Virtual Environment](#create-a-virtual-environment)**

A virtual environment helps isolate the projectâ€™s dependencies from the global Python environment.

1. Navigate to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd your_project_folder
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment with the command:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Deactivate the virtual environment when you're done working:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

---

### **[Install Required Python Packages](#install-required-python-packages)**

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install Python packages that your project needs.

1. **Install packages using pip**:
   ```bash
   pip install <package_name>
   ```
   For example, to install **Flask** (a web framework):
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

2. **Generate a requirements.txt** file to keep track of all the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install packages from the **requirements.txt**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

### **[Setup Database (Optional)](#setup-database-optional)**

Depending on the application you're building, you may need to set up a database.

#### Install and configure a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL):

1. **SQLite** (Built-in with Python):
   - SQLite is simple to set up and doesnâ€™t require a separate server. Itâ€™s useful for small-scale projects.

2. **PostgreSQL/MySQL**:
   - If you want a more robust database, you can install PostgreSQL or MySQL.
   - For **PostgreSQL**, you can use `psycopg2`:
     ```bash
     pip install psycopg2
     ```
   - For **MySQL**, you can use `mysql-connector-python`:
     ```bash
     pip install mysql-connector-python
     ```

3. **Configure database settings** (for example in Flask):
   - In your application, connect to the database by providing credentials and database settings, typically stored in environment variables or configuration files.

---

### 1.5. **[Use Git for Version Control (Optional)](#use-git-for-version-control-optional)**

Git is a powerful version control system that tracks changes to your code and allows for collaboration.

1. Initialize a Git repository in your project folder:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files like your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   __pycache__/
   *.pyc
   venv/
   ```

3. Add your files to the repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

5. (Optional) Push to a GitHub repository:
   - Create a new repository on **GitHub** and follow the instructions to link your local repository.

---

### **[Run Your Application](#run-your-application)**

Once your environment is set up, you can run your Python application. Here's how to run a simple **Flask** app:

1. **Create a simple Flask app** (e.g., `app.py`):
   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def hello_world():
       return 'Hello, World!'

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

2. Run the application with:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

Your app should now be running locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

### **[Example Flask API with Documentation](#example-flask-api-with-documentation)**

Here's an example of how you can set up a **Flask API** with basic documentation.

#### Install Flask and Flask-RESTful:

```bash
pip install flask flask-restful
```

#### Create `app.py` with API documentation:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_restful import Api, Resource
from flask_swagger_ui import get_swaggerui_blueprint

app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)

# Swagger UI setup
SWAGGER_URL = '/swagger'
API_URL = '/static/swagger.json'  # Path to the Swagger JSON
swagger_ui_blueprint = get_swaggerui_blueprint(SWAGGER_URL, API_URL, config={'app_name': "Flask API"})
app.register_blueprint(swagger_ui_blueprint, url_prefix=SWAGGER_URL)

# Simple Resource
class HelloWorld(Resource):
    def get(self):
        return {'message': 'Hello, World!'}

api.add_resource(HelloWorld, '/')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

- **Flask-RESTful**: Makes building REST APIs easier.
- **Flask-Swagger-UI**: Provides an interactive API documentation using Swagger UI.

#### Setting up Swagger:

You can create a **Swagger JSON file** (e.g., `swagger.json`) in the `/static` folder to define the API schema.

```json
{
  "swagger": "2.0",
  "info": {
    "title": "Flask API",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "paths": {
    "/": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "Returns a greeting message",
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "A greeting message",
            "examples": {
              "application/json": {"message": "Hello, World!"}
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Run the app, and access Swagger documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/swagger`.

## **[Using Docker and Docker-Compose](#using-docker-and-docker-compose)**

Docker and Docker Compose are essential tools in modern software development. Docker allows you to package your applications in containers, while Docker Compose helps you manage multi-container applications, like when your app needs a database.

---

### **[Step 1: Create a Dockerfile](#step-1-create-a-dockerfile)**

A **Dockerfile** is a text file that contains instructions on how to build a Docker image. You define the environment, dependencies, and how the application will run inside the container.

#### Example Dockerfile for a Python Application:

1. **Create a `Dockerfile`** in the root of your project folder.
2. Inside the `Dockerfile`, define the following:
   
   ```dockerfile
   # Step 1: Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
   FROM python:3.10-slim

   # Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Step 3: Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
   COPY . /app

   # Step 4: Install any dependencies
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Step 5: Expose the port the app runs on
   EXPOSE 5000

   # Step 6: Define the command to run your app
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

#### Explanation of each step:
- **FROM python:3.10-slim**: This line pulls the Python 3.10 slim image, which is a lightweight version of Python.
- **WORKDIR /app**: This sets the working directory to `/app` in the container.
- **COPY . /app**: This copies all files from your local directory into the `/app` directory of the container.
- **RUN pip install**: This installs dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.
- **EXPOSE 5000**: This makes port `5000` available for the Flask app.
- **CMD ["python", "app.py"]**: This runs the application when the container starts.

---

### **[Step 2: Create a docker-compose.yml](#step-2-create-a-docker-composeyml)**

A **docker-compose.yml** file is used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. If your application has multiple services (e.g., a web service and a database), you can define all the services in this file.

#### Example `docker-compose.yml`:

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml`** file in the root of your project.
2. Inside `docker-compose.yml`, define the following:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'

   services:
     web:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
       volumes:
         - .:/app
       environment:
         - FLASK_APP=app.py
         - FLASK_ENV=development
     
     db:
       image: postgres:13
       environment:
         POSTGRES_USER: user
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
         POSTGRES_DB: mydb
       volumes:
         - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

   volumes:
     pgdata:
   ```

#### Explanation of each section:
- **version**: Defines the version of Docker Compose syntax you're using.
- **services**: Defines the different services in the application.
  - **web**: The Flask application service.
    - `build: .` tells Docker Compose to build the Dockerfile in the current directory.
    - `ports` maps the container's internal port `5000` to the host machine's port `5000`.
    - `volumes` mounts the current directory (`.`) to the `/app` directory in the container.
    - `environment` defines environment variables like `FLASK_APP` and `FLASK_ENV`.
  - **db**: The PostgreSQL service.
    - `image` specifies the Docker image for PostgreSQL.
    - `environment` defines environment variables required to configure the database.
    - `volumes` creates a persistent volume (`pgdata`) to store the database data.
- **volumes**: Defines a named volume for PostgreSQL data persistence.

---

### **[Step 3: Build and Run Your Container](#step-3-build-and-run-your-container)**

Now that you have both the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`, you can build and run your application.

1. **Build the Docker images** by running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Start the services** (both the Flask app and PostgreSQL) by running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will:
   - Build the Docker image as defined in the `Dockerfile`.
   - Start the web service (Flask) and the db service (PostgreSQL) as defined in the `docker-compose.yml`.

3. You can now access the application at `http://localhost:5000` (or the configured port).

#### Running in detached mode:
If you want to run the containers in the background (detached mode), use:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

---

### **[Step 4: Stopping the Container](#step-4-stopping-the-container)**

To stop your containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop all running services and remove the containers. If you want to remove volumes (e.g., PostgreSQL data), add the `-v` flag:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

---

### **[Using Docker-Compose in Development](#using-docker-compose-in-development)**

In development, Docker Compose allows you to easily start, stop, and manage your application's dependencies. You can also take advantage of live code reloading with Docker Compose.

Hereâ€™s how you can optimize your setup for development:

1. **Use Volumes for Code Synchronization**:
   In the `docker-compose.yml`, the `volumes` section maps the local project directory to the container's directory:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - .:/app
   ```
   This allows any changes you make to the code locally to be reflected inside the container.

2. **Enable Flask Debug Mode**:
   Ensure Flask is running in debug mode for live code reloading:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - FLASK_APP=app.py
     - FLASK_ENV=development
   ```

3. **Hot Reloading**:
   Docker Compose in development ensures that the web service will reload when code changes are made (due to the volume mapping). This is similar to running the app locally, but within an isolated environment.

4. **Run Commands in the Container**:
   You can also run commands inside the running container. For example, if you want to run a command inside the web service container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec web bash
   ```
   This opens a terminal inside the container where you can run commands like `flask db migrate`, `python manage.py`, etc.
